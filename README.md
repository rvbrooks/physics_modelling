# physics_modelling

A script for Monte Carlo simulation of the temperature of a single atom in an optical tweezer trap.

## About

This script will fit measured release-and-recapture data with a Monte Carlo thermodynamic simulation and output an estimated atom temperature and uncertainty.
It will also produce a plot of the fit.

For more details on the physics behind the code, see my [PhD Thesis](http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/14468/1/RVB_Thesis.pdf?DDD25+)
